.SH NAME
.PP
cockpit-desktop - Cockpit Desktop integration
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\ \ \ \f[B]cockpit-desktop\f[R] {URLPATH} [SSH_HOST]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[V]cockpit-desktop\f[R] program provides secure access to Cockpit
pages in an already running desktop session.
It starts a web server (\f[V]cockpit-ws\f[R]) and a web browser in an
isolated network namespace, and a \f[V]cockpit-bridge(8)\f[R] in the
running user session.
.PP
This avoids having to log into Cockpit, and having to enable
\f[V]cockpit.socket\f[R] system-wide.
The network isolation ensures that no other user, and not even other
processes in the user\[aq]s session, can access this local web server.
.PP
\f[V]URLPATH\f[R] is the Cockpit page to open, i.
e.
the path component of Cockpit URLs.
It is highly recommended to only open a particular page
frame (https://cockpit-project.org/guide/latest/embedding.html), not the
entire Cockpit navigation and menu.
For example, the path
\f[V]/cockpit/\[at]localhost/storage/index.html\f[R] will open the
Storage page.
It is also possible to give abbreviated forms of urls, such as
\[dq]\f[V]storage\f[R]\[dq] or \[dq]\f[V]network/firewall\f[R]\[dq].
.PP
\f[V]SSH_HOST\f[R] is an optional SSH remote host specification
(\f[V]hostname\f[R] or \f[V]username\[at]hostname\f[R]).
If given, \f[V]cockpit-bridge\f[R] will be started on the remote host
through \f[V]ssh(1)\f[R] instead, i.
e.
the Cockpit web browser will show that remote host.
Note that this is more of an experimental/demo feature.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
The \f[V]BROWSER\f[R] environment variable specifies the browser command
(and possibly options) that will be used to open the requested Cockpit
page.
If not set, \f[V]cockpit-desktop\f[R] attempts to use an internal
minimalistic WebKit browser, and failing that, will attempt to detect
some reasonable alternatives.
